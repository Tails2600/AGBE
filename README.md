# AGBE (Another Game Boy Emulator)
This is a Gameboy Emulator that I am working on.  
Builds of the latest commit can be found in the bin/Debug folder.  
This is currently linux only.(Though it would probably be easy to build for Windows.)  It requires XTerm.(On Linux)  
Not everything is implemented yet so don't expect everything to work correctly.  
If there is a problem or suggetion, put it into Issues.
