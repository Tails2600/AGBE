# AGBE (Another Game Boy Emulator)
This is a Gameboy Emulator that I am working on.  
Builds of the latest commit can be found in the bin/Debug folder.  
This is currently linux only.  (It probably compiles on Windows just fine though.)  
Not everything is implemented yet so don't expect everything to work correctly.  
If there is a problem or suggetion, put it into Issues.
