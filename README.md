# AGBE (Another Game Boy Emulator)
This is a Gameboy Emulator that I am working on.
Latest Windows and Linux builds can be found in the bin/Debug/ folder.
Note that the Windows build will usually be more buggy than the Linux build.
Not everything is implemented yet so don't expect everything to work correctly.
If there is a problem or suggetion, put it into Issues.
